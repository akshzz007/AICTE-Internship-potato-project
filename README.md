#🍂 Potato Disease Detection
📝 About the Project
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based image classification model to detect diseases in potato leaves. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model classifies potato leaves into different categories based on their health conditions. The goal is to help farmers and agricultural researchers quickly identify plant diseases, leading to early intervention and improved crop yield.

🚀 Features
Image-based disease classification: The model predicts whether a potato leaf is healthy or affected by Late Blight or Early Blight.
Deep Learning Approach: Utilizes a CNN model trained on a dataset of potato leaf images.
Dataset Handling: Processes images into training, validation, and testing datasets.
High Accuracy: Model optimized using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Deployment Ready: Can be integrated into a web or mobile application for real-world use.
🛠 Technologies Used
TensorFlow / Keras – for model training and evaluation.
OpenCV & Matplotlib – for image processing and visualization.
Python – for scripting and data handling.
Jupyter Notebook / Colab – for training and experimentation.
